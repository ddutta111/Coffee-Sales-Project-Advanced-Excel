# **Coffee Sales Project Advanced Excel**
Coffee Sales Data analysis using advanced excel formulas and Dashboard creation

## **Overview**

This project is focused on analyzing customer orders and sales data for a coffee business and creating a comprehensive dashboard in Excel to provide key insights. The project covers various Excel functions, data analysis tools, and visualization techniques to transform raw data into actionable insights.

## **Key Formulas and Tools Used**

VLOOKUP 
Used for advanced lookups, this function helps retrieve data from different tables (e.g., customer details based on order ID).

INDEX MATCH 
Combines two functions to perform flexible lookups for sales data based on dynamic criteria, such as looking up sales by product and customer.

Multiplication Formula for Sales 
Simple multiplication of units sold and price per unit to calculate total sales for each order.

Multiple IF Functions 
Used for conditional analysis, including determining discounts, special offers, or customer segmentation based on order size or sales amount.

Date Formatting 
Adjusted date formats to improve readability and consistency, such as converting dates to "DD-MM-YYYY" format.

Number Formatting
Applied currency and percentage formatting for sales data and discount rates to enhance clarity.

Check for Duplicates 
Utilized Excelâ€™s "Remove Duplicates" feature to clean up customer and sales data, ensuring data integrity.

Convert Range to Table 
Converted data ranges into structured tables for easier analysis, with dynamic references for functions like PivotTables.

Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts + Formatting 
Created PivotTables to summarize sales by product, customer, or region, and used PivotCharts to visualize the insights.

Insert Timeline + Formatting 
Added a Timeline filter for the sales data to allow users to filter the dashboard by specific time periods.

Insert Slicers + Formatting 
Inserted Slicers to provide an interactive way to filter PivotTables and charts by product type, region, or customer segment.

Updating the Pivot Table Data Source 
Ensured that new data can be easily incorporated into the PivotTables by updating the data source dynamically.

## **Dashboard Creation Process**

- Integrated PivotCharts, timelines, and slicers into a cohesive dashboard that provides an overview of key performance metrics, such as total sales, top products, and customer distribution.
- Optimized the dashboard by linking PivotTables with the same data source, ensuring that filters and slicers apply to all relevant charts.
- Interactive Filters: Using slicers and timelines to filter data by date range, customer, product, or region.
- Dynamic Updates: The dashboard automatically updates when the underlying data is modified, allowing for real-time analysis.

## **Project Outcome**
The resulting dashboard is a powerful tool that provides a clear view of sales performance and insight on top customers, helping business owners make informed decisions regarding product offerings, marketing efforts, and customer retention strategies.

## **Conclusion**
This project showcases the potential of Excel's advanced functions and visualization tools to create an intuitive and data-driven dashboard for coffee sales analysis.
